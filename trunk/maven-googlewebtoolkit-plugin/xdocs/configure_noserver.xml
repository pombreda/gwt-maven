			<subsection
				name="Start from a working GWT project">
				<p>
				Start from a project that runs in the standard GWTShell and can be successfully
				compiled with the GWTCompiler. 
				<br /><br />
				Compile the project and have the following files, which should be in the compiler out directory (www is the default), handy for later copying to the external container instance:
				<li>[ModuleName].cache.html (the bootstrap script)</li>
				<li>[ModuleName].html (host page)</li>
				<li>gwt.js (common GWT script)</li>
				</p>
			</subsection>
			
			<subsection
				name="Setup an external container context with the necessary GWT files">
				<p>
				Create an external container context where you can "point" the GWTShell.
				<br />
				In Tomcat terms this means create the following:
				<li>a $CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/ModuleName.xml context descriptor</li>
				<li>a $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ModuleName directory</li>
				Then place the files from the previous GWT compile step (nocache.html, Module.html, gwt.js) in the webapps/ModuleName directory.
				<br />
				Then, before proceeding, BROWSE to that location in a regular browser and ensure you can load the host page (it will not show dynamic elements - yet, but still should be present). 
				</p>
			</subsection>
			
			<subsection
				name="Launch the GWTShell directed at the external container instance">
				<p>
				Launch the GWTShell with the -noserver option, and the necessary port and path/host page.
				<br /><br />
				Typically this means using the gwt-maven plugin "gwt:noserver" goal. If you are using
				gwt-maven then you only need to set the correct "google.webtoolkit.runtarget" and "google.webtoolkit.port" properties.
				These should match the context name/host page and port you used when setting up the EXTERNAL container instance. 
				<br /><br />
				If you are not using gwt-maven then you need to edit whatever you are using for a shell startup script (such as the
				ApplicationCreator provided ModuleName-shell script) to include the -noserver option, the -port option and 
				the correct runtarget (contextpath/host page). (If you used the same name as your module for your context, when setting
				up the external container, then you will not need to change the runtarget - this is the recommended setup).	
				</p>
				<p>
				An example MODIFIED shell startup script, for those NOT using gwt-maven, including the -noserver and -port options is shown below:
				<pre>
#!/bin/sh

ENTRY_POINT=com.package.Module
HOST_PAGE=Module.html

APPDIR=`dirname $0`;
CPGWT=$APPDIR/src
CPGWT=$CPGWT:$GWT_HOME/gwt-user.jar
CPGWT=$CPGWT:$GWT_HOME/gwt-dev-mac.jar
java -XstartOnFirstThread -cp $CPGWT com.google.gwt.dev.GWTShell -logLevel DEBUG -noserver -port 8080 "$@" $ENTRY_POINT/
$HOST_PAGE
				</pre>
				</p>
			</subsection>
			
			<subsection
				name="Use whatever you need in the external container">
				<p>
				Once you are using -noserver, in a simple setup such as is described here, you can then 
				also add GWT service servlets (with the correct classes and elements in the deployment descriptor - web.xml),
				other servlets, servlet filters, servlet init-params, data sources, security realms, and so on -
				anything you typically use with any standard container.  
				<br /><br />
				You can also use more advanced JEE containers that can handle EJB, JMS and so on, with this
				same setup. Configuring server side resources becomes just a matter of working with which ever 
				external container you have chosen - AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GWT.
