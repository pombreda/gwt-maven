GWT-Maven simplesdataample
--------------------------

Simple sample that demonstrates what a recommended POM looks like for GWT-Maven usage,
and includes source web.xml and source context.xml for use with the GWT shell through
GWT-RPC (uses and HSQL database and creates a JNDI accessible Tomcat managed pooled DataSource). 

Run with: 

"mvn gwt:gwt" (run the shell) 

or 

"mvn install" (build a war)
