#summary Get the M2 maven-googlewebtoolkit2-sample project running quickly

= Setup =

Install:
 * JDK v1.5+
 * Maven
 * Some svn client of your choice

= Steps (command line) =
 * svn export http://gwt-maven.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/maven-googlewebtoolkit2-sample_ _Check out the sample source from svn_
 * cd maven-googlewebtoolkit2-sample _Navigate to the maven-googlewebtoolkit2-sample directory_
 * Read the README.txt file for notes (the platform change that might be necessary being the import part). 
 * Ask maven to compile, execute.. run the project. Note it'll take a while downloading maven plugins & gwt libraries. You could get timeouts due to load on the servers!
  * mvn clean install _this will build and pack the entire project_
  * cd war
  * mvn gwt:gwt _this will run the webapp in hosted mode_

= Mess with it =
Now, to learn how it works. You can import the maven project in pretty much all IDE's. Like Netbeans v6.4+, IntelliJ and Eclipse (needs m2eclipse plugin and File -> Import).

I hope this gets you on your way!
