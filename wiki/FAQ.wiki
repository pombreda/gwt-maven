There are some gaps between the current checked-in docuemtation and what is deployed.  Here are a few FAQs for until we deploy then next release.

= Details =

*Q)  Cannot assign configuration entry 'compileTarget' to 'class
[Ljava.lang.String;' from '[com.shd.gwt.client.FormEditor]', which is of
type class java.lang.String*

In the latest plugin release.  compileTarget was changed to take an array.  This means you POM should have a section that looks like:

{{{
<compileTarget>
    <value>my.compile.target</value>
</compileTarget>
}}}

rather than 
{{{
<compileTarget>my.compile.target</compileTarget>
}}}


*Q)  Using the POM in the documentation, I cannot download the plugin.*

You need to add a plugin repository:

{{{
<pluginRepositories>
  <pluginRepository>
    <id>gwt-maven</id>
    <url>http://gwt-maven.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mavenrepo</url>
  </pluginRepository>
</pluginRepositories>
}}}
