#summary M1 version FAQ.

= Introduction =

These are commonly encountered questions regarding the M1 version of GWT-Maven. 


= Details =

*Q) How should I setup machine/platform specific properties for M1? 

Use a "build.properties" file which specifies the location of "maven.googlewebtoolkit-home" and the value of "platform".  The idea is to isolate any machine differences in build.properties (and not have such differences in project.properties, or in the POM). 

To do this you need "build.properties" in your home directory (or with the project, home directory supersedes):
*build.properties*
{{{
# maven build properties (goes in ~/.maven)
platform=[mac|windows|linux]
maven.googlewebtoolkit.home=[PATH]/gwt-${platform}-1.4.60
# uncomment the next two properties for GWT-Maven usage on the Mac
#google.webtoolkit.extrajvmargs=-XstartOnFirstThread
#maven.junit.jvmargs=-XstartOnFirstThread -Dgwt.coverage.enable=true
}}}

Then you use "platform" in your POM to define "gwt-dev-platform," so that your project includes gwt-dev, if needed (remember, it's only needed if you need to run the shell, which usually means for GwtTestCase based tests):

*POM dependency for gwt-dev-platform*
{{{
<!-- ~/build.properties must have maven.googlewebtoolkit.home and platform defined  -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.gwt</groupId>
  <artifactId>gwt-dev-platform</artifactId>
</dependency>
}}}

And lastly, in project.properties you need a JAR override for gwt-dev-platform that uses the build.properties values for "maven.googlewebtoolkit.home," and "platform":

*project.properties JAR override for gwt-dev-platform*
{{{
# ~/build.properties must define maven.googlewebtoolkit.home and platform
maven.jar.override=on
maven.jar.gwt-dev-platform=${maven.googlewebtoolkit.home}/gwt-dev-${platform}.jar
}}}
