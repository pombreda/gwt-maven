= Introduction =

gwt-maven is a set of Java Maven support classes, and Maven 1.x and 2.x plugins, that
facilitate both hosted mode development for GWT projects with container managed resources
(such as DataSources) and one step simple construction of deployable WAR files.  

In addition gwt-maven allows you to setup your GWT projects with any structure you like,
defining resource locations in project.properties, and allows you quick access to GWTShell
and GWTCompiler.

See the sample

for more information and documentation (we are using Maven to gen the documentation, and
do not yet have it in the new Google Code Wiki format - but there are docs!).
