#summary 2.0 Plugin Release Criteria


= Introduction =
We need to come up with a list of features to define the next release.  It seems to me, that there are potentially many features that are reasonably major that we can get in, in a short amount of time.

I would like to see us get the following features in, and then kick out a release.  I would also propose we call it 2.0, since there are many large changes:

= Details =

  #  Add tasks to the plugin that can download a GWT zip file, unzip it and use it as the GWT Home.  This allows us to enable a better CI story.
  #  Fix the bean generation bugs and feature requests
  #  Get the Bean Translator to use either Dozer or the BeanMapping classes
(rc: I intend to add a Dozer config file XSL file to the current system. We are using the BeanMapping directly right now in all of our work, and it works well.)
